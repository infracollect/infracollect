description: What's next after creating your first job

Now that you've created your first job, you can start collecting data from your infrastructure.

The strength of infracollect is that no matter where your data is coming from, you can collect it, process it and export
it to your desired destination.

Thanks to the Terraform provider ecosystem, you can collect data from any infrastructure provider, AWS, Azure, GCP,
Kubernetes, and more.

You can also collect data from HTTP APIs, local files and more are coming soon.

But this is just the beginning. What can you do with your collected data?

## Archive your data

The best time to archive your infrastructure data was yesterday. The second best time is today. With an
historical archive of your infrastructure data, you can:

- Identify changes in your infrastructure
- Track the history of your infrastructure
- Ensure compliance
- Generate reports

## Display your data

What happens when you collect all your infrastructure data, your services, applications, databases and more? You just
"need" a little bit of glue and there you go, you got yourself a developer portal.

Stay-tuned, because this is exactly what we're building.
